## Architecture

Aggro follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns:

- **Controllers** — Handle HTTP requests and coordinate responses
- **Models** — Core business logic and data structures  
- **Repositories** — Data access layer for database operations
- **Services** — Domain-specific business logic (archiving, thumbnails)
- **Helpers** — Utility functions for common operations
- **Libraries** — Third-party integrations and custom components

This architecture improves code maintainability, testability, and follows SOLID principles. The clean separation of concerns enables comprehensive unit testing with 372 tests achieving 46.22% line coverage across all architectural layers.

## Local development setup

Aggro uses [Docksal](https://docksal.io) for local development. This ensures a consistent development environment across machines.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Docksal](https://docksal.io/installation)
2. Docker compatible host system

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsnmrs/aggro.git
   cd aggro
   ```

2. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   fin init
   ```

3. View the site:
   - Open http://aggro.docksal.site in your browser
   - The init process creates a local database from aggro-db.sql

### Debugging with Xdebug

Xdebug is enabled by default in the Docksal environment for debugging and profiling:

- **Server name:** `aggro.docksal.site`
- **Port:** `9003`
- **IDE key:** `VSCODE`
- **Coverage:** Enabled for test coverage reports

Configure VS Code to listen for Xdebug connections on port 9003. The debugger will automatically connect when triggered.

**Performance note:** Xdebug may slow down the application. If you experience performance issues during development, you can disable it by commenting out the xdebug configuration in `.docksal/etc/php/php.ini`.

### Development commands

Aggro includes several custom Docksal commands to help with development:

- `fin admin` — Run application maintenance tasks
- `fin deploy [env]` — Deploy to specified environment
- `fin frontend` — Run front-end build process
- `fin maintain` — Run upgrades and tests
- `fin test` — Run test suite
- `fin upgrade` — Update Composer packages

## Configuration

### Environment variables

Copy `.env-sample` to `.env` for your local environment. Key configurations:

- `CI_ENVIRONMENT` — set to “development” for local work
- `app.baseURL` — your local URL (default: http://aggro.docksal.site)
- Database credentials — configured through Docksal
- API keys — for video services

### Sentry configuration

- `SENTRY_DSN` — your Sentry Data Source Name for error tracking
- `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` — environment name (development/production)
- `SENTRY_RELEASE` — application release version
- `SENTRY_SAMPLE_RATE` — error sampling rate (0.0 to 1.0)
- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` — performance monitoring sample rate
- `SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII` — whether to send personally identifiable information

### Storage configuration

The `app/Config/Storage.php` file centralizes all file paths and storage-related settings:

- Thumbnail storage — path, dimensions, and quality settings
- Archive periods — content archival and cleanup timeframes
- Cache durations — default cache times for various operations
- Network timeouts — connection and request timeout settings

### Cron jobs

The `.crontab` file defines scheduled tasks for:

- News feed updates — every 6 minutes
- YouTube video checks — every 5 minutes
- Vimeo video checks — every 7 minutes
- Archive management — daily
- Feed cache clearing — monthly

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing infrastructure with **372 tests achieving 46.22% line coverage** using PHPUnit for unit testing and multiple code quality tools.

### Test Suite Overview

- **Total Tests:** 372 comprehensive unit tests
- **Coverage:** 46.22% line coverage across all components
- **Assertions:** 471 test assertions ensuring thorough validation
- **External Dependencies:** 85 tests appropriately skipped for external services (YouTube/Vimeo APIs, Sentry, file system)
- **Test Files:** 74 test files covering all major components

### Unit Testing with PHPUnit

The test suite includes comprehensive coverage of:

- **Controllers** — HTTP request handling, response coordination, and validation (Feed: 100%, Home: 100%, BaseController: 100%)
- **Models** — Core business logic and data structures (AggroModels: 100%, NewsModels: 37.59%, UtilityModels: 55.88%)
- **Helpers** — Utility functions and common operations with comprehensive parameter validation
- **Services** — Domain-specific business logic (ArchiveService: 96.30%, ThumbnailService: 68.63%)
- **Repositories** — Data access layer operations (ChannelRepository: 100%, VideoRepository: 82.47%)
- **Libraries** — Third-party integrations (SentryService: 12.84%, SentryLogHandler: 19.44%)
- **Filters** — Request/response filtering (SentryPerformance: 12.90%)

Tests use an in-memory SQLite database for fast, isolated testing without affecting your development database. External services are properly mocked or skipped to ensure reliable test execution.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (includes PHPUnit + linting)
fin test

# Run only PHPUnit unit tests
composer test:unit

# Run tests with coverage report (requires Xdebug)
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage composer test:coverage

# Run all Composer test scripts
composer test
```

### Test Coverage Reports

When running tests with coverage, detailed HTML reports are generated in:

- **Coverage reports:** `build/logs/html/index.html`
- **Raw coverage data:** `build/logs/coverage.xml`
- **Current baseline:** 46.22% line coverage, 42.52% method coverage

Open the HTML report in your browser to view detailed coverage metrics by file and function.

**Note:** Coverage reporting requires Xdebug to be enabled. Use `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage` when running coverage commands.

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all linting and static analysis
fin lint

# Run specific checks
fin sniff      # PHP CodeSniffer
fin shellcheck # Shell script linting

# Individual quality tools
fin phpfix     # Auto-fix PHP code style issues
fin phpstan    # Run PHPStan static analysis
```

### Testing Best Practices

The test suite follows TDD principles and best practices:

- **Proper Isolation:** External dependencies (APIs, file system, network) are mocked or skipped
- **Fast Execution:** In-memory SQLite database for rapid test runs
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover success paths, error conditions, and edge cases
- **Clean Architecture:** Testable design with dependency injection
- **External Service Handling:** 85 tests appropriately skipped for YouTube/Vimeo APIs, Sentry, and file operations

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions automatically runs the full test suite (372 tests) on all pull requests, including:

- PHPUnit unit tests with comprehensive coverage validation
- Code style checks (PHP CS Fixer, CodeSniffer)
- Static analysis (PHPStan, PHPMD)
- Shell script linting

All tests must pass before code can be merged, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled through GitHub Actions and Deployer with automated testing:

1. **Pull Request Testing** — All PRs automatically run the complete test suite (372 tests) including PHPUnit tests, code quality checks, and static analysis
2. **Automated deployment** — Deployment to production occurs on merge to main branch (only after all tests pass)
3. **Front-end assets** — Assets are built and included in deployment
4. **Environment files** — Securely transferred during deployment
5. **Crontab updates** — Scheduled tasks are updated on deployment

The CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality by requiring all tests to pass before any code reaches production.

### Manual deployment

```bash
# Deploy to development
fin deploy dev

# Deploy to production
fin deploy prod
```

## Error monitoring

Aggro uses Sentry for application monitoring:

- Real-time error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring for slow requests
- Automatic error grouping and deduplication
- Integration with deployment tracking

Configure Sentry by setting the appropriate environment variables in your `.env` file.
